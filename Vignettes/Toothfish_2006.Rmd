### Historic Data

## Survey Data

Recruitment is backprojected from survey data.  In this case natural mortality is assumed constant,
so it suffices to backproject the recruitment once and use the same recruitment series in all
projections.

Import the survey data
```{r}
survey.df <- read.csv(textConnection("

The `SurveyAdjust` function scales the survey densities to abundance, computes the adjustment scale
abundance to recruitment based survival, and form the weighted geometric means of the estimates of
recruitment.
```{r}
SurveyAdjust <- function(survey.df,Ms,M,rec.age) {
  ## Scale density to abundance
  r <- survey.df$Area*survey.df$ObsTotal/survey.df$ExpTotal
  ab.mn <- r*survey.df$Density
  ab.se <- r*survey.df$SE

  ## Compute log survival adjustment 
  inc <- ceiling((nrow(Ms)-1)*survey.df$Frac)+1
  S <- surveySurvival(survey.df$Year,survey.df$Age,inc,inc,Ms,M,rcls=rec.age)
  
  ## Weight rescaled abundance by 1/cv^2 
  ab.wt <- (ab.mn/ab.se)^2
  ## Compute the year of "recruitment" to the target age class
  rc.yr <- survey.df$Year-survey.df$Age+rec.age
  yr <- seq.int(min(rc.yr),max(rc.yr))
  rec.yf <- factor(rc.yr,yr)
  ## Compute the weighted geometric means
  data.frame(
    Year=yr,
    Rec=exp(tapply(ab.wt*(log(ab.mn)-log(S)),rec.yf,sum)/tapply(ab.wt,rec.yf,sum)))
}
```

Form natural mortalities and compute recruitment estimates.
```{r}
## Constant intra-annual natural mortality
nsteps <- 24
Ages <- 4:35
Days <- seq(0,1,length=nsteps+1)
h <- 1/nsteps
ms <- matrix(1,nsteps+1,length(Ages))
Ms <- ctrapz(ms,h)
M <- 0.13
recruit.df <- SurveyAdjust(survey.df,Ms,M,4)
recruit.df
```

## Catch

Import the corresponding catch data
```{r}
catch.df <- read.csv(textConnection("
Year,Catch
1986,0
1987,0
1988,0
1989,0

```




## Growth

Growth patterns are inferred from length at age data.

Import the length at age data 
```{r}
length.df <- read.csv(textConnection("
Age, Length

length.age <- approxfun(length.df$Age,length.df$Length,rule=2)
plot(length.age,0,55)
```

## Interpolation

Create an age or length based array through interpolation
```{r}
approxArray <- function(x,y,arr,rule=2) array(approx(x,y,arr,rule=rule)$y,dim(arr))
```


## Selectivity

Selectivity varies with year, and may be length or age based. This function creates a list of
selectivity matrices together with an index vector that matches year to the appropriate selectivity.

```{r}
mkSelectivity <- function(ages,ls) {
  select5pt <- function(x) approxArray(x,c(0,0,1,1,0),ages)

  ## Age based selectivity
  ss <- list()
  ## 1986-1994 - age based selectivity
  ss[[1]] <- approxArray(x=c(0.0,4.1,4.9,5.8,7.0,8.4,9.8,13.7,14.9,16.1,17.3,18.4),
                         y=c(0.0,0.0,0.14,0.5,0.8,0.9,1.0,1.0,0.9,0.85,0.4,0.3),
                         ages)
  ## 1995 - length based selectivity
  ss[[2]] <- rampOgive(ls,670,250)
  ## 1996 - age based selectivity
  ss[[3]] <- select5pt(c(0.0,5.8,7.0,8.2,8.4))
  ## 1997 - age based selectivity
  ss[[4]] <- select5pt(c(0.0,4.9,5.8,11.1,13.7))
  ## 1998 - age based selectivity
  ss[[5]] <- select5pt(c(0.0,5.3,5.8,14.9,17.3))
  ## 1999-2004 - age based selectivity
  ss[[6]] <- select5pt(c(0.0,4.1,8.4,16.1,17.3))

  ## Year 1 = 1986
  list(index=setNames(c(rep(1,9),2:5,rep(6,6),1),1986:2005),ss=ss)
}
```


## Model

The `ToothfishProjection` function returns a function that generates a single set of random
projections that differ only in target catch.  The projections within each set use a common random
selectivity and maturity curves, virign biomass and recruitment series, so within a set the
projections only differ by the level of fishing applied.  The resulting function takes a single
numerica argument that is used to identify the set.

The arguments are 

* `Catches` - the catch targets to test
* `Catch.df` - dataframe of historic catches - this must contain the catches for each year from the
  earliest modelled year upto the first projected year, ordered by year.
* `Recruit.df` - dataframe of recruitment estimates from survey data.
* `Length.df` - dataframe of length at age data.
* `n.years` - the number of years to project ahead
* `Year1` - the earliest modelled year.

```{r}
ToothfishProjection <- function(Catches,catch.df,recruit.df,length.df,n.years=35,Year1=min(catch.df$Year)) {
  
  ## Daily time steps with 8 age classes

## Projection

Calling `ToothfishProjection` returns a function that generates a single "run" of the simulation
```{r}
sim <- ToothfishProjection(Catches=c(0,2.8e6,2.84e6,2.85e6,2.9e6,3e6,3.2e6),
                           catch.df=catch.df,recruit.df=recruit.df,length.df=length.df)
```


The function takes a single argument that is used to label the results.  Within a single call to
`sim`, a common set of random maturity, selectivity, initial ages and recruitment series are used to
make projections for each requested target catch.
```{r}
df <- sim(1)
head(df)
tail(df)
```
For these parameters, the recruitment variability has greater impact than increased fishing pressure
```{r}
ggplot(df %>% filter(Year > 2005),aes(x=Year,y=N,colour=factor(Target)))+geom_line()
```

Generate 100 runs and bind them into one large dataframe. The runs are performed in parallel with
the `furrr` library. We use 100 runs here to show the concept most assessments would have a lot more, eg 10,000
```{r}
plan(multiprocess)
system.time(df <- future_map_dfr(1:100,sim))
```

```{r}
ggplot(df %>% filter(Year <= 2005),
       aes(x=Year,y=N,group=Run))+
  geom_line(colour=rgb(0,0,0,0.1))+ylim(0,6E07)
```

```{r,  fig.width=6,fig.height=12}
ggplot(df %>% filter(Year > 2005),
       aes(x=Year,y=N,group=Run))+
  geom_line(colour=rgb(0,0,0,0.1))+
  facet_wrap(~Target,ncol=1)+ylim(0,6E07)
```

Calculate median escapement with quantiles. 
```{r}
grymssb<-df %>% 
  filter(Year==2040) %>% 
  mutate(Status=SSB/SSB0) %>% 
  group_by(Target/1000) %>% 
  summarise(q2.5=quantile(Status,0.025),
            q45=quantile(Status,0.45),
            q50=quantile(Status,0.50),
            q55=quantile(Status,0.55),
            q97.5=quantile(Status,0.975),
            Median=median(Status)) %>% 
  mutate(Model="Grym")

grymssb
```

Calculate probability of depletion. 
```{r}
grymdep<-df %>% 
  filter(Year>2006) %>%
  group_by(Target/1000,Run) %>%
  summarize(Status=min(SSB/SSB0)) %>% 
  summarise(Depletion_prob=mean(Status <= 0.2))%>% 
  mutate(Model="Grym")

grymdep

```

To display the projections we need to calculate the summary statistics for each year and test for each forward projection, as well as for the back projections. We then put these together to plot them. 


Calculating the forward projection stats
```{r}
ssbstat<-df %>% group_by(Target, Year) %>% filter(Year >= 2006) %>% 
  mutate(SSB.Status=SSB/SSB0) %>% 
  summarise(Med=median(SSB.Status), upr=quantile(SSB.Status, 0.975),lwr=quantile(SSB.Status, 0.025),q90=quantile(SSB.Status, 0.9),q10=quantile(SSB.Status, 0.1))
```

Calculating the historic projection stats
```{r}
ssbstatstarts<-df %>% group_by(Year) %>% filter(Year <= 2006) %>% 
  mutate(SSB.Status=SSB/SSB0) %>% 
  summarise(Med=median(SSB.Status), upr=quantile(SSB.Status, 0.975),lwr=quantile(SSB.Status, 0.025),q90=quantile(SSB.Status, 0.9),q10=quantile(SSB.Status, 0.1))
```

Creating the plot: 
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_ribbon(data=ssbstat,  aes(x=Year, ymin=lwr, ymax=upr), alpha=0.2)+
  geom_ribbon(data=ssbstat, aes(x=Year, ymin=q10, ymax=q90), alpha=0.2)+
geom_line(data=ssbstat, aes(x=Year, y=Med))+
  facet_wrap(~Target/1000, scales = "free_y")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red"))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red"))+
  theme_bw()+
